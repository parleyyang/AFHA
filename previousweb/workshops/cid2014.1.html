<p class="title"><i>Infinite-dimensional compressed sensing</i></p>
<p class="abstract">Since its introduction a decade ago, compressed sensing has become an 		intense area research in applied mathematics, engineering and computer science. However, the 		majority of compressed sensing is based on a finite-dimensional, vector space model. On the 		other hand, many problems one encounters in applications are analog; in other words, best 		modelled in infinite-dimensional function spaces. In this talk, I will present a theory and 		set of techniques for compressed sensing in infinite dimensions. I shall first motivate the 		need for this new approach by showing how existing finite-dimensional techniques fail for 		simple problems, due to mismatch between the data and the model. Next I will argue that any 		theory in infinite dimensions requires new assumptions, which extend the standard principles 		of compressed sensing - namely, sparsity and random sampling with incoherent bases - by 		taking into account the influence of asymptotic decay and ordering that are present in 		infinite dimensions. Using these, I will introduce a new framework for infinite-dimensional 		compressed sensing, and show how this bridges an substantial gap in the existing literature. 		Finally, I will end with a surprising conclusion. I will show that this new insight is not 		just pertinent to infinite dimensions, but that it also leads to substantially improved 		approaches for many finite-dimensional compressed sensing problems. 		<br />

<p class="title"><i>Tensor Sparsity of Solutions to High Dimensional PDEs</i></p>
<p class="abstract">Functions of a possibly very large number of variables arise, for instance, 		as solutions to parametric families of PDEs or of PDEs with a large number 		differentiable variables such as the Schr&ouml;dinger equation in quantum chemistry or 		Fokker-Planck equations modeling dilute polymers. The numerical solution of such equations 		is severely hampered by the &quot;curse of dimensionality&quot; which, roughly speaking, 		means that the computational cost required for achieving a desired target accuracy increases 		exponentially with respect to the spatial dimension. 		The central theme of this talk is to break this curse by unveiling a typically hidden 		sparsity of the solutions to such problems. Depending on the nature of the involved 		operators a possible sparsity model is approximability by relatively short sums of 		solution dependent rank-one tensors. Corresponding &quot;regularity theorems&quot; are 		presented that quantify the (near) tensor sparsity of solutions to 		certain high dimensional diffusion equations provided that the data are tensor sparse. 		Moreover, bounds for the computational complexity of such problems are derived 		from a concrete numerical scheme confirming polynomial tractability. 		<br />

<p class="title"><i>Optimal Compressive Imaging using Fourier Samples of Continuous Multivariate 		Data</i></p>
<p class="abstract">&quot;One fundamental problem in applied mathematics is the issue of recovery of 		continuous data from specific samples. Of particular importance is the case 		of pointwise samples of the associated Fourier transform, which are, for 		instance, collected in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Strategies to reduce 		the number of samples required for reconstruction with a prescribed accuracy 		have thus a direct impact on such applications -- which in the case of MRI 		will, for instance, shorten the time a patient is forced to lie in the scanner. 		<!--<br/><br />--> 		In this talk, we will present a sparse subsampling strategy of Fourier samples 		which can be shown to perform optimally for multivariate functions, which are 		typically governed by anisotropic features. For this, we will introduce a 		dualizable shearlet frame for reconstruction, which provides provably optimally 		sparse approximations of cartoon-like images, a class typically regarded as a 		suitable model for images. The sampling scheme will be based on compressed sensing 		ideas combined with a coherence-adaptive sampling density considering the coherence 		between the Fourier basis and the shearlet frame. 		<br />

<p class="title"><i>Isn't the continuum in fact simpler than the discrete world?</i></p>
<p class="abstract">The perhaps greatest achievement in mathematics is Newton and Leibniz' 		invention of the 		differential and integral calculus and thus the passage from the 		discrete world to the continuum. We are here at Chicheley Hall because we all know that 		unfortunately many continuous or infinite-dimensional problem are 		too complicated to be solved directly and that therefore one should step back and replace 		them 		by discrete approximations, which can nowadays be tackled by having recourse 		to the computer. I want to recall that nevertheless 		there are also lots of problems where Newton and Leibniz' original strategy remains 		the magic wand to come to success. 		I present a couple of examples which 		show that certain phenomena concerning large matrices can be 		understood much better by passing from matrices to integral operators.</p>

<p class="title"><i>The finite section method for dissipative Jacobi matrices and Schrodinger 		operators</i></p>
<p class="abstract">We consider how the spectra (eigenvalues and essential spectrum) of certain 		classes of infinite matrix and differential operator can be approximated by the eigenvalues 		of finite matrices. We are particularly interested in the case of the essential spectrum; an 		example of E.B. Davies shows that this may fail to be approximated. We review some 		recent results and some slightly overlooked results of Pokrzywa from the 1970s, and 		present some new theorems which are joint work of the author with Sergey Naboko 		(St Petersburg) and Rob Scheichl (Kent). An application is given to the dissipative barrier 		method for resonances, and we explain why this method is also good for calculating 		eigenvalues.</p>

<p class="title"><i>Computability concepts in spectral computations</i></p>
<p class="abstract">- What do we mean when we ask questions like Can the spectrum of any 		operator be computed?<br />
- Or of an abtract Banach algebra element?<br />
- Can you write down the resolvent in the complement of the spectrum?<br />
<!--<br /><br />--> 		We look what the existing theories of computability say about the possibility to 		compute the spectrum. Starting with matrices we mention the barrier results on the 		possibility to compute 		polynomial roots by generally convergent rational iterations (Doyle, McMullen). 		We remind the &quot;semidecidability&quot; property of Julia sets (Blum, Cucker, Shub, 		Smale) and point out a parallelism with spectral computations in the frame work 		of Banach algebras - leading to an effective functional calculus (ON). 		Computability in the sense of constructivism, computable reals, is mentioned 		together with some basic results (positive and negative) on the possibility to compute 		within this frame work the spectrum of &quot;effectively defined operators&quot; (Pourel, 		Richards). 		With this brief glimpse to existing theories we intend to highlight the landscape 		into which the Solvability Complexity Index are entering. The rest of the talk tries to 		explain in what - rather essential way - this new concept differs from these others. 		We mention some results (Ben-Artzi, Hansen, ON, Seidel), but Anders Hansen, 		who initiated this line of research, shall discuss this in more detail.</p>

<p class="title"><i>Approximation of bandlimited functions with finitely many samples.</i></p>
<p class="abstract">We discuss the approximation of a bandlimited function from finitely 		many (non-uniformly spaced) samples. Whereas the mathematical 		theory usually addresses the question of when such a function in 		$L^2(R)$ can be recovered completely, numerical methods operate with a 		finite-dimensional model. The numerical reconstruction or approximation of the original 		function 		amounts to the solution of a large linear system. 		We show that the solutions of a particularly efficient discrete model in which 		the data are fit by trigonometric polynomials converge to the solution of the 		original infinite-dimensional reconstruction problem. This legitimatizes the 		numerical computations and explains why the algorithms produce 		reasonable results. This method is an early example of generalized 		sampling.</p>

<p class="title"><i>Estimating the n-width of solution manifolds of parametric PDE&rsquo;s</i></p>
<p>Numerous computational model reduction methods, such as <br />
reduced basis and its generalization, proper orthogonal decomposition, generalized<br />
empirical interpolation, rely on the implicit assumption that the solution<br />
manifold, that gathers the solution to a PDE as parameters vary, can <br />
be well approximated by low dimensional spaces. This is made more<br />
precise by assuming that the Kolmogorov n-width of the manifold has <br />
certain decay. In this talk, I shall discuss strategies that allow to<br />
rigorously establish rates of decay for the Kolmogorov n-width<br />
of solution manifolds associated with relevant parametric PDE&rsquo;s,<br />
where the parameters are infinite dimensional. One key result is<br />
that the rate of decay of n-width of sets in Banach space is almost <br />
preserved under the action of holomorphic maps.</p>

<p class="title"><i>Inverse problems in acoustics regularized by sparsity</i></p>
<p class="abstract">Many inverse problems can be solved using regularization based on sparsity, 		as for example in compressed sensing. 		However, some problems have no clear discrete structure, and thus require a continuous 		modeling as for example using 		finite rate of innovation (FRI) signal models. 		<!--<br /><br />--> 		One area where continuous models and sparsity using singularities is well adapted is 		acoustics and electromagnetics. 		Point sources are Diracs in space, and reflectors like walls create image sources. 		<!--<br /><br />--> 		Equipped with this model, we attack classic problems in acoustics. First is the question 		&ldquo;can one hear the shape of a room?&rdquo;, or, 		do room impulse responses between a source and a few microphones uniquely specify the shape 		of a room. 		The answer is positive, and involves an algorithm that performs echo sorting using the rank 		property of Euclidean distance matrices. 		<!--<br /><br />--> 		Based on the insight of using sources and their images (or reflections) we can attack 		calibration problems, where the most 		general case is ''blind calibration'', namely we have N microphones, M sources and an 		unknown room, and it is possible, 		under certain conditions, to recover positions of receivers and sources as well as the shape 		of the room. 		Further applications of the basic echo sorting technique can be found in acoustic beam 		forming and indoor localisation. 		<!--<br /><br />--> 		The echo sorting algorithm being mildly combinatorial represents a computational challenge, 		but in many cases of interest, 		side information is available to make the problem tractable. 		<br />

<p class="title"><i>Optimizing the optimizers - an adaptive approach to image 		reconstruction.</i></p>
<p class="abstract">When assigned with the task of reconstructing an image from given data 		the first challenge one faces is the derivation of a truthful image and data model. Such 		a model can be determined by the a-priori knowledge about the image, the data and their 		relation to each other. The source of this knowledge is either our understanding of the 		type of images we want to reconstruct and of the physics behind the acquisition of the 		data or we can thrive to learn parametric models from the data itself. The common 		question arises: how can we optimise our model choice? 		Starting from the first modelling strategy this talk will lead us from the total 		variation as the most successful image regularisation model today to non-smooth second- 		and third-order regularisers, with data models for Gaussian and Poisson distributed data 		as well as impulse noise. Applications for image denoising, inpainting and surface 		reconstruction are given. After a critical discussion of these different image and data 		models we will turn towards the second modelling strategy and propose to combine it with 		the first one using a bilevel optimization method. In particular, we will consider 		optimal parameter derivation for total variation denoising with multiple noise 		distributions and optimising total generalised variation regularisation for its 		application in photography. 		<br />

<p class="abstract">Variable splitting schemes for the function space version of the image 		reconstruction problem with total variation regularization (TV-problem) in 		its primal and pre-dual formulations are considered. In the primal splitting 		formulation, while existence of a solution cannot be guaranteed, it is shown 		that quasi-minimizers of the penalized problem are asymptotically related 		to the solution of the original TV-problem. On the other hand, for the predual 		formulation, a family of parametrized problems is introduced and a 		parameter dependent contraction of an associated fixed point iteration is 		established. Moreover, the theory is validated by numerical tests. Additionally, 		the augmented Lagrangian approach is studied, details on an implementation 		on a staggered grid are provided and numerical tests are shown.</p>

This line of research may be considered 		as the limiting case of high-dimensional integration, 		and it is motivated, e.g., by computational 		problems arising for stochastic processes. 		<!--<br /><br />--> 		We discuss 		the structure of the underlying function spaces, 		namely, Hilbert spaces with reproducing kernels 		given as weighted superpositions of tensor product 		kernels, and we present a typical result for integration in 		this setting. 		<!--<br /><br />--> 		Additionally, 		we discuss a new kind of embedding result, which is 		employed in the analysis. 		<br />

<p class="title"><i>Sparse, Adaptive Quadrature Methods for Bayesian Inverse Problems of 		Parametric Operator Equations</i></p>
<p class="abstract">We present and analyze a class of sparse Smolyak quadrature 		methods for Bayesian inverse problems of parametric operator equations. 		<!--<br /><br />--> 		The proposed method relies on a parametric, deterministic reformulation of 		Bayesian inverse problems with distributed parameter uncertainty 		from possibly infinite dimensional, separable Banach spaces, 		with known prior probability measure on the uncertain distributed parameter. 		<!--<br /><br />--> 		The goal of computation is to evaluate moments or quantities of interest 		under the Bayesian posterior, conditional on given noisy observational data. 		<!--<br /><br />--> 		For forward problems belonging to a certain sparsity class, 		the parametric, deterministic density of the Bayesian posterior belongs to 		the same sparsity class. 		<!--<br /><br />--> 		Instances of the considered class of forward problems are definite or 		indefinite elliptic and parabolic evolution problems, 		with scalar or tensorial unknowns and with possible uncertainty in domains, 		and high-dimensional initial value problems with uncertain coefficients. 		<!--<br /><br />--> 		The results suggest in particular dimension-independent convergence rates 		for data-adaptive Smolyak integration algorithms, so that the proposed 		approach is suitable for application to the infinite dimensional setting. 		<!--<br /><br />--> 		We address asymptotic scaling limits of the posterior in the vanishing 		observation noise variance limit. The asymptotics motivate a novel 		``variable metric'' preconditioner of the adaptive Smolyak algorithm. 		<!--<br /><br />--> 		Results from selected numerical experiments confirming the 		theoretical findings will be presented. 		<br />

<p class="title"><i>A calculus for the optimal quantification of uncertainties</i></p>
<p class="abstract">The past century has seen a steady increase in the need of estimating 		and 		predicting complex systems and making (possibly critical) decisions with 		limited information. Although computers have made possible the numerical 		evaluation of sophisticated statistical estimators (or models), these 		estimators are still designed ``by humans'' because there is currently no 		known recipe or algorithm for dividing the design of a statistical estimator 		into a sequence of arithmetic operations. 		Indeed, enabling computers to ``think'' as ``humans'' have the ability to do 		when faced with uncertainty is challenging in two major ways: 		(1) Finding optimal statistical estimators remains to be formulated as a 		well posed problem when information on the system of interest is incomplete 		and comes in the form of a complex combination of sample data, partial 		knowledge of constitutive relations and a limited description of the 		distribution of input random variables. 		(2) The space of admissible scenarios along with the space of relevant 		information, assumptions, and/or beliefs, tend to be infinite dimensional, 		whereas calculus on a computer is necessarily discrete and finite. 		<!--<br /><br />--> 		With this purpose, this talk will describe the development of a form of 		calculus allowing for the manipulation of infinite dimensional information 		structures (based on reductions of optimization problems over variables such 		as measures over measures and functions) and its application to the optimal 		quantification of uncertainties in complex systems, the investigation of 		Robust Bayesian Inference under finite information (finite co-dimensional 		classes of priors), the identification of new Selberg integral formulae and 		the scientific computation of optimal statistical estimators.</p>

<p class="title"><i>Near-Optimal Quantization of Redundant and Compressive Measurements</i></p>
<p class="abstract">We will present a new noise-shaping based quantization and 		reconstruction algorithm for frame measurements. For any given quantization alphabet 		size, this algorithm provides near-optimal accuracy for random frames as well as some 		classical deterministic frames. With a suitably adapted reconstruction method, we will 		show that this algorithm also yields near-optimal quantization for compressive sampling 		systems. The methods are applicable to both finite and infinite dimensions. Additional 		features of the proposed algorithm include low computational cost and parallel 		implementability. 		<br />

<p class="title"><i>On Spectral Inclusion Sets and Computing the Spectra and Pseudospectra 		of Bounded Linear Operators</i></p>
<p class="abstract">We derive inclusion sets for the (pseudo)spectrum of an infinite Jacobi 		matrix $A$, understood as a bounded linear operator on $L^2(Z)$. The 		first inclusion set is the union of certain pseudospectra of $n\times n$ principal 		submatrices of $A$. In a second version 		we work with lower bounds on $n \times \infty$ and $\infty \times n$ submatrices of 		$A-\lambda I$ , which 		effectively leads to the study of related $n \times n matrices. The latter procedure is 		motivated by work on 		second order spectra of Davies, and Davies &amp; Plum, and on higher-order versions by 		Hansen. 		Our third set not only yields an upper bound but also an approximation of the 		(pseudo)spectrum of 		$A$ as $n \to\infty$. We discuss extensions of our results to band operators of higher 		bandwidth and 		band-dominated operators, and to matrices $A$ with operator entries. We illustrate the 		results by computing spectral inclusion sets for a particular random operator studied by 		Feinberg and Zee. 		<br />

<p class="title"><i>Can everything be computed? - On the Solvability Complexity Index and 		Towers of Algorithms</i></p>
<p class="abstract">This talk addresses some of the fundamental barriers in the theory of 		computations. Many computational problems can be solved as follows: a sequence of 		approximations is created by an algorithm, and the solution to the problem is the limit 		of this sequence (think about computing eigenvalues of a matrix for example). However, 		as we demonstrate, for several basic problems in computations (computing spectra of 		infinite dimensional operators, solutions to linear equations or roots of polynomials 		using rational maps) such a procedure based on one limit is impossible. Yet, one can 		compute solutions to these problems, but only by using several limits. This may come as 		a surprise, however, this touches onto the boundaries of computational mathematics. To 		analyze this phenomenon we use the Solvability Complexity Index (SCI). The SCI is the 		smallest number of limits needed in order to compute a desired quantity. 		In several cases (spectral problems, inverse problems) we provide sharp results on the 		SCI, thus we establish the absolute barriers for what can be achieved computationally. 		For example, we show that the SCI of spectra of self-adjoint infinite matrices is equal 		to two, thus providing the first algorithms to compute such spectra in two limits. 		Moreover, we establish barriers on error control. We prove that no algorithm can provide 		error control on the computational spectral problem or solutions to infinite-dimensional 		linear systems. In particular, one can get arbitrarily close to the solution, but never 		knowing when one is &quot;epsilon&quot; away. In addition, we provide bounds for the SCI of 		spectra of classes of Schrodinger operators, thus we affirmatively answer the long 		standing question on whether or not these spectra can actually be computed. Finally, we 		show how the SCI provides a natural framework for understanding barriers in 		computations. In particular, we demonstrate how the impossibility result of McMullen on 		polynomial root finding with rational maps in one limit, and the framework of Doyle and 		McMullen on solving the quintic in several limits, can be put in the SCI framework. 		<br />
