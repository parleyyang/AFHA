<p>The paper <em>&quot;IMPROVED SPATIAL RESOLUTION AND TARGETED SAMPLING IN       MRI&quot;</em> by <em> <a href="/research/afha/bogdan/">Bogdan         Roman</a> (DAMTP), <a href="http://radiology.medschl.cam.ac.uk/about-us/departmental-staff/research-staff/dr-martin-j-graves/">Martin          J Graves</a> (Radiology), <a href="/research/afha/anders/">Anders         Hansen</a> (DAMTP), <a href="http://radiology.medschl.cam.ac.uk/about-us/departmental-staff/academic-staff/professor-david-j-lomas/">David          J Lomas</a> </em> (Radiology) was selected by the University     after an internal competition as the University's nomination for the     prestigious Rosetrees Interdisciplinary Prize 2016 (250,000 GBP).     This is collaborative work between DAMTP, Radiology departments and     Cambridge University Hospitals on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI),     using General Electric 1.5T and 3T scanners.<br />

<font color="#009900"> </font>The work showcases&nbsp; visible resolution       improvement and much shorter acquisition time simultaneously in a       clinical setting. This can impact both clinical and     research applications, allowing for improved morphological and     functional imaging with the potential for earlier and improved     diagnosis and     outcomes.     For example, in the brain we could detect subtle changes in cortical     structure as a sign of early dementia, or smaller lesions associated     with myelin changes in early multiple sclerosis, or improve the     diagnosis of intracerebral vascular pathologies. In oncology, e.g.     breast cancer, such improvements could impact on our ability to     detect and classify smaller lesions resulting in increased survival     rates.<br />

The above work extends the practical proof of concept <a href="/research/afha/people/bogdan/#siemens">validation</a>     done by Siemens in 2014 of the compressed sensing research by the     DAMTP authors.<br />

The <a href="http://www.rosetreestrust.co.uk/">Rosetrees Trust</a>     was established in 1987 to fund life-changing medical research. The     Rosetrees Interdisciplinary Prize is an annual award for innovative     and impactful interdisciplinary research on biomedical problems. The     Trust's goal is to give researchers the opportunity to experiment     with ideas and become future leaders in their field. It is founded     on the principle that basic research is a crucial cog in the     scientific wheel and can, ultimately, lead to the major discoveries     of the generation.</p>
